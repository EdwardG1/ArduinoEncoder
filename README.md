# ArduinoEncoder
This code is written to be used with the game Il-2 Sturmovik for simulation purposes.
This code takes inputes from 2 encoders that dictates the x and y axis of the mouse. Connect the x-axis encoder to A0 pin and the y-axis to the A1 pin. 
Connect a button to pin:A2 to emulate a left click, A3 to emulate pressing the "b" key, 15 to emulate pressing the "d" key, 7 to reset the toggle, or 16 to reset the mouse position
